# Spotify-project
The aim of this project is to find which genres are the most influentials, in order to do that, we used the API from spotify and a network analysis. This project has been done in collaboratiomn with **Federeico Stenico** (in the report, is specified the role of each one). The beginning expectation was that most popular genres could be the most influentials.
